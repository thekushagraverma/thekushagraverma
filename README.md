# About Me

My name is <b>Kushagra Verma</b>. I am currently pursuing a <i>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering</i> at <i><b>Lovely Professional University</b></i>. I have always been fascinated by the field of technology and innovation. Even though I am a novice in coding, I opted for engineering because I really like creating projects and cracking tough problems. <br><br>
My interests lie in both software development and physical systems, especially in fields that are aerospace-related. I'm excited to learn how computational thinking can be used to solve real-world problems, and I'm looking forward to developing my skills through practical experience and ongoing learning.


## Currently Learning
After 4 years, I would already be familiar with
- **Languages** - Python, HTML, CSS.
